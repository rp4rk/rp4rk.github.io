Across the Lagan from the city centre, the house was described as a hidden gem in the context of what the city has to offer. The house required rebranding, and as part of the process a new website was desired.</p><hr><div class="img-center" markdown="1"><br><img src="/img/hearts.png" alt="Heart of the Park"><br></div><hr><h1 id="Project_Role">Project Role</h1><p>My primary roles in the project were web development, graphic design, and photographer.

This new logo functioned well not only as an identifying brand, but also was modifiable for the wide array of events the park house would be host to.</p><p>Once the new logo and by-line were set in stone, I was responsible for communicating with print shops in order to acquire accurate specifications to create signage, letterheads, and more merchandise.</p><hr><div class="row post"><br><div class="twelve columns post-img"><br><img src="/img/scph_merchandise.jpg"><br></div><br></div><hr><h1 id="Web_Development">Web Development</h1><p>The website was built using SASS and Wordpress.
