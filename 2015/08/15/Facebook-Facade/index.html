<h1 id="Project_Information">Project Information</h1><p>Facebook Facade was the culmination of my undergraduate dissertation, a web development project that exposed security risks involved in using popular social media websites such as Facebook in real time. The project not only involved interaction with REST apis, but also understanding of SSL, and had a widespread range of media assets from print to digital. The project succesfully acquired the details of over 350 users, and was exhibited at Flowerfield Arts Centre in July 2015.</p>

<h1 id="Web_Components">Web Components</h1><p>Facebook Facade worked by relying on a security flaw present in Facebook if presented with the user agent for Chrome version 24. By doing this the content security policy was not enforced, which allowed data to be sent via a client-side browser plugin to my own SSL secured server. The plugin would scrape the information of the userâ€™s friends, likes, and actions while on Facebook. This was displayed beside the Facebook terminal, showing users that their information and that of their friends could be accessed.</p>
<p>The information that was sent to the external server was then processed and stored, being later used for a dynamic infographic that showed exactly how many users participated and how many people were compromised by the security flaw.</p>

<h1 id="Print_Components">Print Components</h1><p>Beyond digital components such as those mentioned beforehand, print media was required to advertise the project and also to place in the display booth for Flowerfield. A book, fliers, and large signs were all created using Adobe InDesign, all of which follow the set Facebook brand guidelines.</p>
