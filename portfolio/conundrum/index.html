The player has to choose to accept the proposed benefit and setback, or forgo the benefit and setback entirely.</p><p>Conundrum is built on <a href="https://www.meteor.com/">Meteor</a> and <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>, with <a href="https://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a> serving as the database. Meteor provides reactivity and a framework that is isomorphic from the ground up. Angular provides intuitive data-binding, but at the cost of wrestling with Angular-Meteor. MongoDB is currently the only database that works with Meteor, however progress is currently being made on a Postgresql implementation.</p><h2 id=features>Features</h2><h3 id=stripe-subscriptions>Stripe Subscriptions</h3><p>A subscription model has been implemented using the <a href=https://stripe.com>Stripe</a> API, which was pleasant to work with from start to finish. The accounts system is augmented with Facebook login using the accounts-Facebook package.</p><p>The benefits of a NoSQL database were seen here, as accounts registered with Facebook and accounts registered using the built-in site interface had a completely different schema. Regardless of that, Stripe integration went smoothly.</p><h3 id=memorable-urls>Memorable URLs</h3><p>A typical URL for Conundrum looks like <a href=https://www.conundrum.lol/conundrum/RoastedSardonicAndeancondor>Roasted Sardonic Andeancondor</a>, it follows a pattern that looks like <code>Adjective + Adjective + Animal</code> in order to provide a more memorable URL than a random hash, with a much larger number of permutations. The total number of permutations for this solution is just over 4 billion, enough to have 5 conundrums submitted every second for 25 years. A standard 5 length alphanumeric string would have only 900 million permutations, and would be much less memorable.</p><h3 id=responsive-interface>Responsive Interface</h3><p>The front end for Conundrum is entirely responsive, and works on every size of device from phone to desktop. This was more of a challenge than anticipated, content can vary from a single line to an entire paragraph, this combined with the large amount of animation made accommodating a wide range of devices a task.</p><p><img src=/images/conundrum-responsive-example.jpg alt="Responsive Example"></p><h3 id=rich-and-performant-animations>Rich and Performant Animations</h3><p>A standard set from my previous explorations in performant CSS, every animation on Conundrum is optimized and capable of running at the 60 frames per second benchmark. Animations were a must to enhance the experience, and the overall result is very pleasing.</p><p>Each animation doesn&#39;t trigger content reflow, and is handled entirely through CSS. Animations run smoothly even on budget hardware.</p><h3 id=stack-overview>Stack Overview</h3><p>A more in depth analysis of what the Conundrum application uses:</p><ul><li>NGINX web server using a reverse proxy to the meteor application. Used for easy SSL management.</li><li>Meteor Up for easy deployment and ENV management.</li><li>Meteor/MongoDB/AngularJS for the application.</li><li>SASS and Jade for CSS precompilation and markup.</li><li><a href=https://github.com/whatsnewsaes/Skeleton-Sass>Skeleton-SASS</a> for a lightweight framework.</li><li>GitHub for code management.</li></ul><h4 id=external-links>External Links</h4><ul><li><a href=https://conundrum.lol><i class="fa fa-desktop"></i> - Conundrum Live Website</a></li><li><a href=http://codepen.io/r_p4rk/pen/xwMwOw><i class="fa fa-codepen"></i> - Conundrum UI Experiment</a></li></ul></article></div></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class="p2 wrap"><div class="measure mt1 center"><small>built with <a href="http://www.metalsmith.io/">metalsmith</a> & <a href=https://github.com/johnotander/pixyll>pixyll</a></small></div></div></footer><script src=/js/scripts.js></script><script>(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
